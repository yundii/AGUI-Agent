# Build your own AI Agent using Microsoft Agent Framework & AG-UI

## Overview

**Build an AI agent console app using AG-UI.**

In this workshop, you'll build a console-based client-server application featuring streaming UI, tool calling, and human-in-the-loop workflows.

### Goal
By the end of this workshop, you will have a working console app with:
- An AI agent hosted on an AG-UI server
- A client that streams responses in real time
- Backend and frontend tools
- A human-in-the-loop approval workflow

**Each section builds on the previous one. Follow them in order.**

## [0. GitHub Token](0.%20GitHub%20Token/README.md)

**Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).**

We will use an AI model hosted on GitHub. Your AG-UI server needs a PAT to authenticate with GitHub and make requests to the model API.

### Goal
By the end of this step, you will have:
- A GitHub PAT created
- The PAT saved locally

## [1. Server Setup](./1.%20Server%20Setup/README.md)

**Build an AG-UI server to host your AI agent.**

The server runs the agent's logic and exposes it via HTTP endpoints.

### Goal
By the end of this step, you will have:
- A running AG-UI server
- An AI agent hosted on the server
- An HTTP endpoint listening for requests

## [2. Client Setup](2.%20Client%20Setup/README.md)

**Create a user interface that connects to the server and displays streaming responses from your agent.**

The client is where users interact with the agent and see results in real time.

### Goal
By the end of this step, you will have:
- A client connected to the AG-UI server
- User input sent to the agent
- Agent responses streamed and displayed in the UI

## [3. Tools](./3.%20Tools/README.md) 

**Add function tools your agent can call to perform specific tasks.**

Tools allow agents to do more than generate text — they can interact with external systems and modify UIs.

### Goal
By the end of this step, you will have:
- A backend tool that return the weather for a location
- A frontend tool that changes the console text color
- An agent that decides when to call each tool

## [4. Human-in-the-Loop](./4.%20Human-in-the-Loop/README.md)

**Add function tools that require human approval before your agent can execute them.**

Human-in-the-loop keeps humans in control of high-impact or sensitive actions.

### Goal
By the end of this step, you will have:
- A tool that requests user approval before creating a text file
- An agent that pauses while waiting for input
- The ability to approve or reject action and resume execution
